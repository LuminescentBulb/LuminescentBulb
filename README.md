Hey there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Taemin Kim, a junior at the University of Michigan studying Data Science ðŸ“Š. Right now, I split my time between wrangling data, building web apps, and getting a bit too invested in grand strategy games.

### What I'm About
- **Aspiring data scientist, software engineer, and (maybe one day) game developer**. Still figuring things out, but enjoying the process.
- **Tech stack comfort zone:** Python, React, Next.js. I dabble in machine learning, though I wouldn't call myself an expertâ€”yet.
- **Current projects:**  
  - Building an interactive dashboard about intra-EU migration data.  
  - Developing a browser-based MMO political simulation (think Paradox, but with more chaos and questionable alliances).

### More About Me
I spend my downtime plotting world domination in Paradox games (Victoria 3 especially), drumming on pretty much anything that makes noise, and getting way too into debates about cities, politics, and what actually makes a place livable.

If you want to talk code, games, or city planning (or you just need a drummer), feel free to reach out.
